why do i have to write these, so exhausting
as always, I have no clue what to write here.
Basically, I am beginning to dip my toes in C, with some frustration, and a lot fo growing spite. 
Learning C is fun, however, implementing it with some of the exercises demands further research, which i am not eager to do.
