//with Boolean logic, the declared variable can either be true or false, which is kinda what Boolean characters are all about.
//if true, the carible is stored as 1
//if false, it is probable stored as 0
//To make bool more intuitive and easier to use, the solution is to to include another library, the bool library.
	//When this criteria is met, the datatype can now be represented with a lowercase b in bool
	//Also, the bool variable can no be represented with text, either true or false, neither of which should be in any quotes. 
//So far I still don't know if i can recieve input for Bool, but that's fine, lets move on for now.
